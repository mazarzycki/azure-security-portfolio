# 🔐 Azure Security Portfolio – by Marek Zarzycki

Welcome to my cloud security portfolio, where I document and demonstrate my practical skills in **Microsoft Sentinel**, **Microsoft Defender XDR**, **KQL**, and **Azure Security best practices**.

This repository supports my learning journey through the **SC-200** and **AZ-500** certifications and showcases hands-on projects, detection rules, automation playbooks, and blog content to share real-world Azure security insights.

## 🚀 Objectives

- Master Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Endpoint/XDR, and KQL
- Build and publish real-world detection use cases and automation workflows
- Document lessons learned, challenges faced, and implementation strategies
- Share practical blog content for visibility and contribution
- Demonstrate growth in Azure Security over time (2025–2026)
